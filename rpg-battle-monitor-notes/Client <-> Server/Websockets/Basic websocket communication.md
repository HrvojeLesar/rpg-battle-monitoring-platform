Basic requirements
- Client connects to server
- While loading all data display loading screen/text before rendering any scenes
- Server holds a list of entities, each with a unique id and the type of entity a client can load
	- Some basic entities are [[scene]], [[grid]], [[Token]]
	- On the server store these in a table with columns 
		- game id, 
		- unique object id,
		- object type,
		- data (as json, text, binary, compressed)

# Messages

- All messages will have a **room** associated with them (Room can also be a game id or some other unique identifier)
- All object that a user will interact with and create will have unique identifiers that are generated by the user (uuid).
- Any message just calls a function that applies that messages payload:
	- e.g. moving position would message of **type** action, with **function** that defines setting the position of an entity

## Message List
- [[Join]]
- [[Action]]

## Websocket connection flow
[[Client]] connects to a websocket and [[Websocket authorization|authorizes]]. After a successful authorization a socket connection is established. Socket connection [[Websocket authorization#^43deb3|lasts for 60 seconds]] if the client does not emit a [[Join|join]] message.

After [[Join|join]] message is received server will start sending
