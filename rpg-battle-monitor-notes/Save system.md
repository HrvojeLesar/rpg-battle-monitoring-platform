Server only holds entities. Each entity has the following rough shape:
```
uid: uuid v7 generated by the user
game: id of the game this entity belongs to
kind: kind of entity represented
timestamp: time when the messege is sent to the server
...
user_defined_fields: ...any valid json serialized fields
```

When receiving a message, server will add the entity to a [[Entity queue|queue of entities to save]] and periodically save entities to the database in chunks.
**ANY** received entity that is already queued and has a timestamp that is before the currently queued timestamp will be **DISCARDED**.
